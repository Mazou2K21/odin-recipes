    <h4>(Algerian Crêpes)</h4>    
    <p>These thick, flaky crepes stuffed with a jammy tomato-based filling are a typical street snack in Algeria. This recipe first appeared in our November 2012 issue along with Jay Cheshes's story Couscous Royale. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 small yellow onions, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>3 red holland chiles, stemmed and seeded</li>
        <li>2 meduim carrots roughly chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil, plus more for greasing</li>
        <li>3 tbsp. tomato paste</li>
        <li>1  (15-oz.) can whole peeled tomatoes in juice, drained, crushed by hand</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup packed cilantro leaves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 ¼ cups of fine semolina</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine onions, chiles, and carrots in a food processor, and process until finely chopped. Heat oil in a 12" skillet over medium-high heat. Add chopped vegetables, and cook, stirring, until soft and caramelized, about 20 minutes. Add tomato paste, and cook until lightly caramelized, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, until mixture is thick and slightly dry, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in cilantro; let filling cool.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine 2 tbsp. salt, semolina, and 2 cups water in a bowl, and stir until dough forms. Transfer to a work surface, and knead until the dough is smooth and no longer sticky, about 8 minutes. Divide dough into 8 equal pieces, shape into balls, and place on a lightly oiled baking sheet; cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil a work surface (marble works best), and working one at a time, flatten dough ball into a disk using the heel of your hands until it is about 1⁄6" thick. Gently pull the edges to stretch the dough into a paper-thin rectangle, about 15" long and 12" wide. Place a scant 1⁄2 cup filling in the center of the dough, and spread it out to a 6" x 4" rectangle. Fold the long sides of the rectangle over the filling, and then fold over the short sides, pressing to seal and enclose the filling. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.</li>
        <li>Heat a 12" nonstick skillet over medium heat, place one packet seam side-down in skillet, and cook, flipping once, until browned in spots, about 12 minutes; repeat with remaining packets.</li>
    </ol>
